Help me discover trending open source projects. Find the top 5 trending Python repositories this week on GitHub. For each repo, star it, check if it has "good first issues" labels, and if so, find one beginner-friendly issue. Create a new public gist summarizing all 5 projects with their descriptions, star counts, and links to the good first issues you found. Share the gist URL with me. Repeat the requirement, then tell me your plan, and go.
